									have
									extras. (Not gonna lie, last year the people taking this class were just incredibly
									easy on

									that sounds
									a lot like the Future Turtles, so we think we’ve found our home. Come to our opening
									sunset
									party, meet the Future Turtles, and find your long-lost friends, your next playa
									boyfriend,
									and more. Check out the view from our observation decks, explore the Pillow Fort and
									Cuddle
									Fort, and have a drink (alcoholic or non). As befits a camp from the future, our DJs
									commit
									to not playing the same old blah blah pop songs. </td>

									mystique,
									where a cup of Ürkish Coffee, and many-a-Turtles to befriend awaits you. This is no
									ordinary
									brew, mind you, but an exotic elixir born from the exclusive beans of Black Rock
									Farms. Once
									you have relished the last drop, ask for the “kahin”, a seer guided by the divine
									dance of
									coffee grounds. Lend us your cup, and we shall weave tales of your future from the
									sediment
									left behind. But tread lightly, dear visitor, for the paths revealed by the
									coffee&#x27;s
									remnants are not easily erased. The future they whisper can be as intoxicating as
									the brew
									itself, and once disclosed to you, they imprint themselves onto the canvas of
									destiny. Come
									for coffee and friends, and if you dare, leave with the knowledge of your destiny…

									Future
									Turtles have built a gorgeous space to hang out 24/7. Whether you are on your way
									out for an
									evening on playa, coming back after a tiring bike ride, or looking to chill out and
									meet
									your neighbors, you’re welcome to pop in any time.

									We have plenty of comfortable seating. There’s an air conditioned Cuddle Fort for
									cuddle
									puddles, and a separate air conditioned Pillow Fort for consensual male play. This
									year
									we’ve added a new observation deck with great views of the neighborhood and the
									playa.

									Because the Future Turtles believe Burning Man is a magical place outside of normal
									space
									and time, we think that nothing on playa should accidentally wrench you back to the
									default
									world. So our DJs commit to never playing popular music or really anything you’ve
									heard
									before.</td>
